General process of app


generate 100 cow(dots) coordinates (need a longitude and latitude) and store the
cows data in a database

Place 100 dots on the grid and create a geofence

set the geofence to inform when dots exit the area

change location of every dot every 5 seconds to somewhere else in the grid

num = random number between 0 and 100

at moment of change num cows will be placed outside the grid

Send notification to employee - done via communication between the app 
and the arduino

print on console " num cows have left the grid"

When arduino read this a boolean value is sent through the system and
the arduino light turns on notiying the farmer

The notifcation also informs the farmer of which cow is outside the geofence
The information is as follows: cow id, gender and age


Details

The cow information will be stored on google clouds SQL database

We will use radar.io to create a geofence surrounding the farm

An server will manage the conection process between the radar.io and the arduino, 
radar.io and the database and the database and the application

The application will contain in itself the following:

- The main page -) map of the farmers land and the suronding with a polygon shape
 acting as the boarders
 This will also show all the dots (cows) and their mouvement

- An datapage -) will will contain information of all the cows


Why is this important to a farmer?

An application like this would be useful as it would provid a real time demographic
of cow mouvements in the area, and help farmer keep track of their cattle

This can also allows farmer to analyze what areas on the farm need better fencing 
or more protection as if multiple cows keep getting out of the geofence from a specific
location. This will help the farmer improve the maintenance of his land.
